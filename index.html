  <p> White Water Writers has been an independent publisher of YA fiction since 2009.  We focus on talent development, working with groups of young authors to unlock their potential and confidence.  </p>

<p> We work with schools and universities, taking students though an intensive week-long course in creative writing  using the TooManyCooks method. Groups start with a blank page on Monday morning, are lead through a series of exercises and processes and publish their own collaboratively written novel on Friday afternoon.</p> 

<p> Nobody outside the group touches a key during the process - everything is entirely the work of the students involved</p>
