    <p>George Rollins just wants to play his games. And sharing a cabin with three other kids is not his idea of fun. To make matters worse, one of his cabin mates seems a bit batty. Will he ever make friends here? Bruce Thompson lives to the constant toll of his mother’s bell. He looks forward to finally getting a break from his mother’s strict rules. Hopefully his sister, Alisha, won’t tell on him. Twins, Lorrie and Terry, bring their hobbies to camp: sketches and photography. And a secret between them could change the whole weekend. Tensions spark with each activity. How will camp end?</p>
