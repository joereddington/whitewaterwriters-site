    <p>10 normal students in middle school and one 3 year old in nursery. They all have their different groups like the popular girls, the gymnasts and the clumsy guy. They hate each other. They have to come together to bring back the parents who have mysteriously disappeared; it is pretty hard with a robot in the way! All of them have special abilities; they just have to know how to use them in a good way. Time is running out- can they bring the adults back or will they grow up without them… Could you bring them back if you were here? Read this story of exciting adventures and see if they can bring them back!</p>
