    <p>Jaspar Chapman has been to hell and back in these last couple of months. When he found out his sister, Georgie, was murdered in a hit and run manslaughter, he is determined to find out who killed his sister. Milly Edison has been trying to help her father, Joshua, who got lung cancer from his work. But, Milly can’t cope; she faced a similar difficulty when her mother died. So she then makes the biggest mistake of her life and it is all uncovered by a witness, but no-one knows if this mysterious man is telling the truth. Joshua takes his boss to court, but will it all go to plan for him and Milly? Will Joshua die? And will Jaspar take revenge for his sister?</p>
