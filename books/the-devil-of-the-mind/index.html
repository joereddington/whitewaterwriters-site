    <p>THE INVESTIGATOR Picking up his daughter from school, Chief Inspector Dean, a man of great wisdom and experience, stumbles upon a schoolyard brawl that will have massive consequences for the citizens of London. THE COLLEGE Blacksmiths College, an unassuming sixth-form in North London, will forever be tainted by a series of events that will leave millions shamed, embarrassed, and disgraced. THE ART TEACHER A seemingly innocent teacher with a dark past, who preys on the weak and vulnerable, will create upheaval and reveal secrets that are better not to be spoken of. THE HEAD OF I.T A dangerous teacher with a vast knowledge of computer hacking - little does he know his life is about to be turned upside down as he tries to defend his students from a cyber-attack.</p>
